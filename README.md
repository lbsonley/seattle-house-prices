## Single and Multivariate Linear Regression Gradient Descent

Example of Linear Regression Gradient Machine Learning Algorithm.

Uses [Kaggle Data Set of House Sales Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/sameersmahajan/seattle-house-sales-prices/version/1)

Single feature (`single.py`) is pretty much copy pasted from [Davi Frossard's blog post on Linear Regression](cs.toronto.edu/~frossard/post/linear_regression/)

I adapted the single feature example to work with multiple features in `multi.py`.
